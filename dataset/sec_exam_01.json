        "answer": "The ICMP attack uses up network capacity leading up to the Target (or the network of the Target), thereby making that network capacity unavailable. In addition, the processing of ICMP ECHO replies may use up processing (CPU) capacity of the Target, making that host unavailable"

    {
        "question": "Explain the difference between a direct DDoS attack and a reflector DDoS attack",
        "answer": "A direct DDoS attack involves hosts under the control of the attacker directly performing an attack (by sending messages) on a target. A reflector DDoS attack involves hosts under control sending messages to uncontrolled (normal) hosts in the network, that then perform an attack on the target"

    {
        "question": "State two advantages of a reflector DDoS attack (compared to direct DDoS attack).",
        "answer": "1. Potential of many more nodes participating in the attack, since the attacker can use uninfected nodes. 2. Harder for target to identify the attacker because traffic comes from many random uninfected nodes."

    {
        "question": "Explain why MAC-based authentication cannot be used as a digital signature.",
        "answer": "A MAC function uses a shared secret key. A message authenticated with a MAC function confirms that the message was generated by either the of the parties that has the secret. It does not confirm which of the two parties generated the message (which is the purpose of a digital signature)."

        "question": "Describe two advantages of using tunneling mode (versus transport mode) of IPsec.",
        "answer": "IPsec only needs to be configured on routers, not on all PCs; hide the IP addresses of the originating and destination nodes."
